    title: "Two girls with two lumps",
    description: `Once upon a time, there were two girls in a small village who both had the same lumps on their faces. One girl grew up in poverty but had a lively personality. She always sang, brought smiles to others, and kept a positive attitude despite her not-so-nice appearance. Otherwise, the girl living in a rich family was a very difficult person.
The poor little girl came across some weird monsters who loved dancing and singing. It turned out that they helped her remove the lump from her face.
Knowing the secret, the rich girl pretended to meet monsters by chance. Unluckily, she ended up getting one more lump on her face.
Guess what was the reason?

    description: `A man met a Toad in a paddy field. After a while getting to know each other, he decided to get married to the Toad although everyone was laughing at him and his wife.
Everyone thought that the Toad was a useless animal. But they were so surprised when the Toad won in the cooking and sewing competitions.
With the intention of humiliating the couple, they held a final competition where they could choose the most beautiful wife. Unluckily, they failed to achieve their goal. The Toad transformed into a very beautiful woman standing beside her husband.
Everyone just looked at the beautiful couple with awe and wonder.

    description: `A porcelain pot with a broken handle is abandoned in a secluded land. When the winter comes, two butterflies are looking for a place to hide from the cold weather. Luckily, the pot is a perfect shelter, warm and dry enough for them to survive through this harsh season.
But when the winter passes, the butterflies fly far away. The pot is so upset, and he thinks no one wants to make friends and stay with him forever. In his most desperate moment, a little girl appears and decides to bring him home. She cleans the pot inside out and also sows some seeds in his body. A short time later, strangely enough, he feels something is moving in his body. And booooom… surprisingly, many beautiful flowers are blooming from the pot. Since then, he has lived happily with his new friends!`,

And welcomes little fishes in,
