    title: "Two girls with two lumps",
    description: `Once upon a time, there were two girls in a small village who both had the same lumps on their faces. One girl grew up in poverty but had a lively personality. She always sang, brought smiles to others, and kept a positive attitude despite her not-so-nice appearance. Otherwise, the girl living in a rich family was a very difficult person.
The poor little girl came across some weird monsters who loved dancing and singing. It turned out that they helped her remove the lump from her face.
Knowing the secret, the rich girl pretended to meet monsters by chance. Unluckily, she ended up getting one more lump on her face.
Guess what was the reason?

A mother bird is crying and seeking justice for her baby who has fallen out of the nest and into the river. It seems to be the grasshopper's fault at first, but it is one part of a causal chain.

    description: `A porcelain pot with a broken handle is abandoned in a secluded land. When the winter comes, two butterflies are looking for a place to hide from the cold weather. Luckily, the pot is a perfect shelter, warm and dry enough for them to survive through this harsh season.
But when the winter passes, the butterflies fly far away. The pot is so upset, and he thinks no one wants to make friends and stay with him forever. In his most desperate moment, a little girl appears and decides to bring him home. She cleans the pot inside out and also sows some seeds in his body. A short time later, strangely enough, he feels something is moving in his body. And booooom… surprisingly, many beautiful flowers are blooming from the pot. Since then, he has lived happily with his new friends!`,
