            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>
              I'm Ngoc Vo, a Graphic Designer, Illustrator, and now, a rising
              ceramic artists too!
            </p>
            <p>
              From a young age, I explored different art mediums like watercolor
              and gouache, participating in exciting art competitions (and even
              winning some little awardsâ€”what a thrill for a kid!).
            </p>
            <p>
              I earned my Bachelor's degree in Architecture Design in 2010, but
              my heart led me to Graphic Design, where I worked full-time until
              late 2024. Now, I embrace the creative freedom of being an
              independent artist, focusing on Illustration and Graphic Design.
            </p>
            <p>
              My work blends both traditional and digital mediums, with
              storytelling at its core. I believe stories bring art to life,
              creating deeper connections with the audience.
